# Yearly PhD progress report for 2014

The progress report tells the tale of what I did in the period between March
2013 and March 2014.

As an experiment, I wrote this report in an IPython notebook
(`phd-report-2014.ipynb).
Here is a [rendered version of this
notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pinga-lab/phd-yearly-report-2014/blob/master/phd-report-2014.ipynb).
There is an image missing from the notebook (in the "Forward modeling"
section).
The PDF version of this report contains all the images so I recommend you view
that instead.
