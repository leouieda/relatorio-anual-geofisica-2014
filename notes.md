# Project overview

Gravity inversion in spherical coordinates.
Important because of global coverage of data from satellites.
Needed for large scale interpretations (like in Nature paper).
Need to develop new algorithms for inversion.
Most are developed for prisms (Li and Oldenburg, Zhdanov, Silva Dias, Oliveira Jr, Uieda and Barbosa, Martins).
Can adapt and improve upon existing methods.
Before computing inverse, need reliable forward modeling first.

Forward modeling with tesseroids.
Literature investigate many ways of doing.
Using recursive division scheme to guarantee accuracy.
