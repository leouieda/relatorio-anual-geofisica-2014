      "# Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Gravity inversion in spherical coordinates.\n",
      "Important because of global coverage of data from satellites.\n",
      "Needed for large scale interpretations (like in Nature paper).\n",
      "Need to develop new algorithms for inversion.\n",
      "In this project, I'll focus on two main inversion schemes: linear inversion for a 3D density distribution, and non-linear inversion for the relief of an interface.\n",
      "The non-linear inversion is useful for mapping the relief of a geologic interface, like the cristaline basement of sedimentary basins and the Moho.\n",
      "The linear 3D inversion is useful for investigating the three-dimensional shape geologic features, like intrusive bodies, possible mantle plumes, magmatic underplating, suture zones, volcanic magma chambers, etc.\n",
      "Currently only one for spherical coordinates (Carl\u00e3o).\n",
      "A lot of room to adapt and improve upon existing methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many inversions are performed in the frequency domain (Parker, lithoflex, Oldenburg, Spherical harm of moon).\n",
      "The advantage of frequency domain inversion is the increased speed of computations.\n",
      "The disadvantage is that it is that regularization is implicit (usally by filtering).\n",
      "This makes it more difficult to control the constraints that are inserted, like similarity with previous results, compactness, sharp variations in the model (e.g., faults and contacts), etc.\n",
      "Space-domain inversions are usually formulated using prisms and allow better use of regularization techniques (Weighted smoothness, Martins, Zhdanov, Silva Dias, Last and Cubic).\n",
      "However, space-domain inversions pose challenges in the computational front.\n",
      "The main bottlenecks are commputing the sensitivity matrix and solving the linear systems.\n",
      "Different algorithms have been developed to mitigate these problems: wavelet compression, quadtree and octree meshes, moving footprint, new one by Cristiano, Uieda and Barbosa, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of computational infrastructure is needed to solve these inversions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reliable forward modeling (new Geophysics paper about fwd models).\n",
      "* Framework for solving regularized inverse problems.\n",
      "* A way to deal with large computational loads (primarily in building the sensitivity matrix).\n",
      "* 3D plotting of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this project, we propose to build this computational infrastructure.\n",
      "We will also investigate novel algorithms for regularization, parametrization, and ways to decrease the computational load.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Forward modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "Forward modeling is done with tesseroids (spherical prisms).\n",
      "Literature investigated two ways of doing it (Taylor series and GLQ).\n",
      "We chose the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature for its better numerical accuracy (Wild-Pffeifer, etc).\n",
      "Problem: setting the number of GLQ nodes to guarantee accuracy.\n",
      "Solution: using recursive division scheme (similar Chinese guys).\n",
      "We attempted to quantify the error involved in the computations by comparing with the analytic formulas for the half-sphere.\n",
      "We investigate an optimum tradeoff between computation time and accuracy to achieve a modeling error bellow GOCE accuracy.\n",
      "We have implemented the forward modeling in two open-source software packages: Tesseroids and Fatiando a Terra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesseroids is written in the ANSI C language.\n",
      "It employs a Unix style command-line interface with many component programs that do different tasks.\n",
      "These components can be combined in a shell script to produce a final result.\n",
      "Tesseroids implements the resursive division scheme using recursive function calls.\n",
      "This has the advantage of a straight forward implementation.\n",
      "However, it makes error handling more dificult and is subject to hard to find bugs, like stack overflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatiando a Terra is a geophysical modeling and inversion library written in the Python language.\n",
      "It serves a wide range of applications, mainly in potential field methods and seismology.\n",
      "It leverages the power of Python's large infrastructure for scientific computing (e.g., libraries like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and Mayavi).\n",
      "The recursive division scheme implemented in Fatiando a Terra uses a stack, or LIFO (last-in-first-out), algorithm to avoid recursive function calls.\n",
      "This is more complex to implement but has the advantage of being faster and more robust.\n",
      "Our results are consistent across implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## A framework for inverse problems\n",
      "\n",
      "Making a software to solve an inverse problem involves the implementation of:\n",
      "\n",
      "* forward modeling\n",
      "* regularizing function\n",
      "* building the required matrices\n",
      "* an optimization method\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these can be automated and reused between different inversion methods.\n",
      "Forward modeling can have several applications, for example forward modeling with tesseroids can be used to terrain correction, non-linear inversion, and linear inversion.\n",
      "Conventional regularizing functions (damping, smoothness, total variation) are usually problem independent.\n",
      "Gradient descent optimization methods are also problem independent and require only knowledge of the Hessian matrix, gradient vector, and value of the goal function for different parameter vectors.\n",
      "Heuristic optimization methods require only knowledge of the value of the goal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "This large reusability potential is prime for building an application programing interface (API).\n",
      "An API implements the components that are common among different inversions.\n",
      "When implementing a new inversion method, the user of the API uses these components to build the new functionality.\n",
      "This minimizes the amount of code one needs to write for a new problem.\n",
      "Optimaly, the API allows the user to try different combinations of methods of optimization and regularization with little or no effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have built such an API using an object oriented (OO) approach in the open-source software package Fatiando a Terra.\n",
      "Fatiando already contains a range of forward modeling routines.\n",
      "It also implements the forward modeling with tesseroids discussed above).\n",
      "Fatiando a Terra is implemented in the Python laguange.\n",
      "It uses the array processing library NumPy to handle dense matrices and  and SciPy\n"
