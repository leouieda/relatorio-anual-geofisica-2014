      "\n",
      "Gravity inversion in spherical coordinates.\n",
      "Important because of global coverage of data from satellites.\n",
      "Needed for large scale interpretations (like in Nature paper).\n",
      "Need to develop new algorithms for inversion.\n",
      "In this project, I'll focus on two main inversion schemes: linear inversion for a 3D density distribution, and non-linear inversion for the relief of an interface.\n",
      "The non-linear inversion is useful for mapping the relief of a geologic interface, like the cristaline basement of sedimentary basins and the Moho.\n",
      "The linear 3D inversion is useful for investigating the three-dimensional shape geologic features, like intrusive bodies, possible mantle plumes, magmatic underplating, suture zones, volcanic magma chambers, etc.\n",
      "Currently only one for spherical coordinates (Carl\u00e3o).\n",
      "A lot of room to adapt and improve upon existing methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many inversions are performed in the frequency domain (Parker, lithoflex, Oldenburg, Spherical harm of moon).\n",
      "The advantage of frequency domain inversion is the increased speed of computations.\n",
      "The disadvantage is that it is that regularization is implicit (usally by filtering).\n",
      "This makes it more difficult to control the constraints that are inserted, like similarity with previous results, compactness, sharp variations in the model (e.g., faults and contacts), etc.\n",
      "Space-domain inversions are usually formulated using prisms and allow better use of regularization techniques (Weighted smoothness, Martins, Zhdanov, Silva Dias, Last and Cubic).\n",
      "However, space-domain inversions pose challenges in the computational front.\n",
      "The main bottlenecks are commputing the sensitivity matrix and solving the linear systems.\n",
      "Different algorithms have been developed to mitigate these problems: wavelet compression, quadtree and octree meshes, moving footprint, new one by Cristiano, Uieda and Barbosa, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of computational infrastructure is needed to solve these inversions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reliable forward modeling (new Geophysics paper about fwd models).\n",
      "* Framework for solving regularized inverse problems.\n",
      "* A way to deal with large computational loads (primarily in building the sensitivity matrix).\n",
      "* Plotting of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this project, we propose to build this computational infrastructure.\n",
      "We will use this infrastructure to develop 3D inversion methods in spherical coordinates using tesseroids.\n",
      "We will also investigate novel algorithms for regularization, parametrization, and ways to decrease the computational load."

      "# Forward modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "Forward modeling is done with tesseroids (spherical prisms).\n",
      "Literature investigated two ways of doing it (Taylor series and GLQ).\n",
      "We chose the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature for its better numerical accuracy (Wild-Pffeifer, etc).\n",
      "Problem: setting the number of GLQ nodes to guarantee accuracy.\n",
      "Solution: using recursive division scheme (similar Chinese guys).\n",
      "We attempted to quantify the error involved in the computations by comparing with the analytic formulas for the half-sphere.\n",
      "We investigate an optimum tradeoff between computation time and accuracy to achieve a modeling error bellow GOCE accuracy.\n",
      "We have implemented the forward modeling in two open-source software packages: Tesseroids and Fatiando a Terra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesseroids is written in the ANSI C language.\n",
      "It employs a Unix style command-line interface with many component programs that do different tasks.\n",
      "These components can be combined in a shell script to produce a final result.\n",
      "Tesseroids implements the resursive division scheme using recursive function calls.\n",
      "This has the advantage of a straight forward implementation.\n",
      "However, it makes error handling more dificult and is subject to hard to find bugs, like stack overflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatiando a Terra is a geophysical modeling and inversion library written in the Python language.\n",
      "It serves a wide range of applications, mainly in potential field methods and seismology.\n",
      "The recursive division scheme implemented in Fatiando a Terra uses a stack, or LIFO (last-in-first-out), algorithm to avoid recursive function calls.\n",
      "This is more complex to implement but has the advantage of being faster and more robust.\n",
      "Our results are consistent across implementations."

      "# A framework for inverse problems\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mathematical background\n",
      "\n",
      "## Software implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "Making a software to solve an inverse problem involves the implementation of:\n",
      "\n",
      "* forward modeling\n",
      "* regularizing function\n",
      "* building the required matrices\n",
      "* an optimization method\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these can be automated and reused between different inversion methods.\n",
      "Forward modeling can have several applications, for example forward modeling with tesseroids can be used to terrain correction, non-linear inversion, and linear inversion.\n",
      "Conventional regularizing functions (damping, smoothness, total variation) are usually problem independent.\n",
      "Gradient descent optimization methods are also problem independent and require only knowledge of the Hessian matrix, gradient vector, and value of the goal function for different parameter vectors.\n",
      "Heuristic optimization methods require only knowledge of the value of the goal function.\n",
      "\n",
      "This large reusability potential is prime for building an application programing interface (API).\n",
      "An API implements the components that are common among different inversions.\n",
      "When implementing a new inversion method, the user of the API uses these components to build the new functionality.\n",
      "This minimizes the amount of code one needs to write for a new problem.\n",
      "Optimaly, the API allows the user to try different combinations of methods of optimization and regularization with little or no effort.\n",
      "In short, the goals we set for an inverse problems API are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Provide a consistent interface for executing the inversions.\n",
      "2. Enable writing code that corresponds to the mathematics.\n",
      "3. Automate the process of implementing a new inverse problem.\n",
      "4. Allow code reuse and recombination requiring as little new code as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have built such an API in the open-source software package Fatiando a Terra.\n",
      "Fatiando already contains a range of forward modeling routines.\n",
      "It also implements the forward modeling with tesseroids discussed above).\n",
      "Fatiando a Terra is implemented in the Python laguange and takes advantage of the large number of scientific libraries available, notabily:\n",
      "\n",
      "* NumPy: an array processing library used for dense matrices and linear algebra operations.\n",
      "* SciPy: collections of functions built on top of NumPy. Offers a range of utilities, from sparse matrices to signal processing.\n",
      "* matplotlib: the standard for 2D plotting library in Python.\n",
      "* Mayavi: a Python interface to the VTK 3D visualization library.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new inverse problems API in Fatiando was designed with an object oriented (OO) approach.\n",
      "The main classes in the API are `Objective` and `Misfit`.\n",
      "`Objective` represents an objective function, i.e., a scalar function of the parameter vector $p$.\n",
      "All other classes in the API are derived from `Objective`.\n",
      "`Objective` has three main methods: `Objective.value`, `Objective.gradient`, and `Objective.hessian`.\n",
      "These methods take a parameter vector as an argument and return the value, gradient vector, and Hessian matrix, respectively, of the objetive function.\n",
      "However, how to calculate these three quantities is problem specific and has to implemented by the class that derives from `Objective`.\n",
      "\n",
      "`Objective` also has methods that estimate the parameter vector that minimizes it: \n",
      "\n",
      "* `Objective.newton`: Newton's method.\n",
      "* `Objective.steepest`: Steepest descent.\n",
      "* `Objective.levmarq`: Newton's method with the Levemberg-Marquardt algorithm.\n",
      "* `Objective.acor`: Ant Colony Optimization for Continuous Domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "`Misfit` is derived from `Objective` and represents an $\\ell_2$-norm data misfit function.\n",
      "In addition to the methods of `Objective`, `Misfit` adds the following methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Misfit.predicted`: returns the predicted data vector.\n",
      "* `Misfit.residuals`: returns the residual vector.\n",
      "* `Misfit.jacobian`: returns the Jacobian (sensitivity) matrix.\n",
      "* `Misfit.fit`: estimates the minimum of the data-misfit function using the configured optimization method.\n",
      "* `Misfit.config`: configures the optimization method used by `fit`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `predicted` and `jacobian` methods are the only ones that are problem specific.\n",
      "Thus, implementing a new inversion is only a matter of creating a derivative class of `Misfit` and implementing these two methods (see section \"Sample implementation of non-linear 2D gravity inversion\").\n",
      "\n",
      "`Misfit.fit` and `Misfit.config` are the main methods used across all inverse problems in Fatiando a Terra.\n",
      "This provides a consistent interface for all inversion methods: first create a data misfit object, then call `fit` to run the inversion.\n",
      "The solution (parameter vector that minimizes the objective function) is stored in the `Misfit.p_` attribute.\n",
      "The attribute `Misfit.estimate_` stores an optionally formatted version of `Misfit.p_` and it's use is prefered.\n",
      "The formatted solution can be used to convert the parameter vector into a more useful object, like a geometric shape representation, velocity instead of slowness for tomography problems, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "`Misfit` and `Objective` support the binary addition (+) and multiplication (*) operators.\n",
      "Addition of two or more `Misfit` or `Objective` instances creates a new object whose `value`, `gradient`, and `hessian` methods return the sum of the corresponding methods for each component of the addition.\n",
      "Multiplication is only supported for a scalar (floating point or integer) and behaves in the same way as addition.\n",
      "These operations can be combined to form a new objective function that is the weighted sum of other objetive functions. \n",
      "For example, the objective function\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\Gamma (\\mathbf{p}) = \\theta(\\mathbf{p}) + 0.1\\phi(\\mathbf{p})$$\n",
      "\n",
      "could be created by the following code:\n",
      "\n",
      "    gamma = Theta(...) + 0.1*Phi(...)\n",
      "\n",
      "in which `Theta` and `Phi` are classes derived from `Objective` or `Misfit`. \n",
      "The inversion can then be run in the same way as for a single objective function: by calling `gamma.fit()` or `gamma.config(...).fit()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The addition operator can also be used with more than two objects, allowing the use of multiple regularizing functions and joint inversion.\n",
      "For the moment, joint inversion is limited only to problems that share the same parameter vector (like gravity and gravity gradients both use density).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatiando a Terra provides a few ready-to-use regularizing functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Damping`: damping or Tikhonov order zero regularization.\n",
      "* `Smoothness1D`, `Smoothness2D`, and `Smoothness3D`: smoothness or Tikhonov order one regularization for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems.\n",
      "* `TotalVariation1D`, `TotalVariation2D`, and `TotalVariation3D`: sharpness or total variation regularization for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "These classes are all derivatives of `Objective` and can be used without any modification.\n",
      "For example, damping regularization can be used in any inverse problem as:\n",
      "\n",
      "    gamma = Theta(...) + 0.001*Damping(number_of_parameters)\n",
      "    gamma.fit()\n",
      "    \n",
      "The patter of creating an instance of a derivative of `Misfit` or `Objetive` and then calling `fit` is maintained throughout Fatiando a Terra.\n",
      "An example of this is the `LCurve` class, that runs the inversion and finds the optimal regularization parameter $\\mu$ that falls in the \"elbow\" of the data-misfit x regularizing function curve.\n",
      "This class is used as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "    misfit = Theta(...)\n",
      "    regul = Damping(misfit.nparams)\n",
      "    solver = LCurve(misfit, regul, [0.000001, 0.001, 0.1, 10, 1000])\n",
      "    solver.fit()\n",
      "    \n",
      "Calling `solver.fit()` runs the inversion using the values of $\\mu$ specified by the third argument to `LCurve`, creates an L-curve, and automatically finds it's \"elbow\" point. \n",
      "The optimal value for $\\mu$ is stored in `solver.regul_param_`. \n",
      "The solution obtained using the optimal $\\mu$ is stored in `solver.p_` and `solver.estimate_`.\n",
      "Notice that `LCurve` runs several inversions in the background but maintains the same interface as a standard inversion with a fixed $\\mu$."
